// TODO (1): Type "stl". This is the shortcut to create a stateless widget
// Everything in Flutter are composed widgets. Even apps are widgets! Hence, we
// are creating this stateless widget to hold the contents of our app.
// TODO (2): Name the stateless widget, "MyApp"
// TODO (3): Now replace the null on line 4 with MyApp().
// Doing this runs our newly created widget that holds the contents of our app

// NOTE: Running the app now may give errors. This is normal! It will be fixed
// in the coming steps.
