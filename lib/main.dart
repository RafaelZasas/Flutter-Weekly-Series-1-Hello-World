// TODO (1): Type "stl". This is the shortcut to create a stateless widget
// Everything in Flutter are composed widgets. Even apps are widgets! Hence, we
// are creating this stateless widget to hold the contents of our app.
// TODO (2): Name the stateless widget, "MyApp"
// TODO (3): Now replace the null on line 4 with MyApp().
// Doing this runs our newly created widget that holds the contents of our app

// NOTE: You should see a blank black screen if everything goes correctly.
// If you're getting an error similar to failed assertion: _child == null, do a cold restart.
// A cold restart involves pressing the stop button and then pressing the play button again.
