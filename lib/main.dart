// TODO (1): Write a main method of type void
// TODO (2): Within main(), call the runApp() method.
// TODO (3): Notice how you get an error? This is because runApp is not defined. We need to import a library that defines runApp.
// TODO (4): Move the cursor to the squiggly line under runApp.
// TODO (5): Tap Alt+Enter (Ctrl+. in VS Code).
// TODO (6): Notice how you have three libraries to choose from
//  1. 'package:flutter/material.dart': Material package contains all the widgets,
//      methods, etc. according to the material design guidelines.
//  2. 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart': Cupertino package contains all the widgets,
//      methods, etc. according to the iOS design guidelines.
//  3. 'package:flutter/widgets.dart': The widgets package is a subset of the material
//      package. Hence, we can import the parent materials package instead.
// We almost always choose the material package as we prefer to follow Google's
// cross-platform Material Design Guidelines
// TODO (7): Choose the material package from the Alt+Enter intention actions.
// TODO (8): Pass null as a parameter to runApp(). We will implement the app to run in the next steps.
