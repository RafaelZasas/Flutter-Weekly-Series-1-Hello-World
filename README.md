## 1. Hello World App

There's a higher omnipotent deity that tells us to start each new CS language we learn with a "Hello World" app. The last time someone disobeyed this deity, their apartment was found vacant and there was no trace of that person.

For the sake of our safety, we will do what this deity wants. Hence, our first app with be the, yup you guessed it â€” "Hello World" app.

### Structure

The app has been divided into steps. Each step has starter and solution code. You can access each code set using the respective branches.

A recommended way to follow this repo is to compare the starter and solution branches for each step.
You can do this on GitHub or in Android Studio/VS Code.
